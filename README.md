# Extendiable-Hasing In Java
 Extendible hashing performed in java where g varied from 2-5 and size of bucket is 6.Extendible hashing is an approach which is dynamic i.e. it allows insertions and deletions to occur without resulting in poor performance after many occurrences of these operations. In my solution I had maded a class bucket which can contain 6 keys and  a hash class which has an array list with the directory names and each of these directories have reference to the object of bucket.
